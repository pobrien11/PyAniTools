PyAniToolsSetup App

Warning, if you have windows file explorer open, and it showing any of the these folders, it won't delete properly. A windows bug it seems. 

1. Download to C:Downloads, and set the member var self.setup_dir = "C:\\Users\\Patrick\\Downloads" in pyani.core.toolsinstall.py AniToolsSetup class _init_

2. Run a clean install - no shortcuts on desktop, no C:\PyAniTools, .nuke unmodified and no custom nuke folder

3. Run again, should only update app data, app mngr and nuke custom folder

4. Run again, but this time reset .nuke, should update .nuke with plugin path, app data, app mngr and nuke custom folder

5. Check install date correct

6. Check that task scheduled
