CHANGELOG
=========

v1.0.2
======

* Fixed logging not turning off when you toggle Show Log in the Gui

* Disable frame range input when it is N/A for multiple sequence selection

* Fixed bug where selecting no files showed error in the console

* Fixed frame ranges breaking when prefixed by _, now suppport any character as a frame prefix

* Fixed custom user frame ranges, previously not working. Now a user can provide any frame range:

	If frame range is 1001-1100, the following are all valid
		1005-1050,
		1001-1050
		1005-1100
	Additionally will accept ranges outside the sequence frame range, for example if the range is 1100-1200:
		1001-1200 is acceptable, backfills 1001-1099 with frame 1100
		Typical usage would be you run frames 1001-1050, but frame 1001 and 1002 failed. The tool can 'patch'
		those missing frames with 1003.the same is true for frames after the sequence end.

v1.1.1
======

* Added command line interface

* Refactored AniFrame to have constructor to build from an int

  copy to temp dir


v1.1.2
======

* Fixed combine sequence code, broke, due to change in pyani.media.image.seq.AniImageSeq class is_member function, and
  updated the combine code to use pyani.media.image.core.AniFrame

* Combine movie name now uses the uncombined parent direcotry for output

v1.2.1
